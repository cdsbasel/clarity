Given the promise of large language models (LLMs) for understanding and predicting human behavior, it is crucial to develop a clear plan for tapping into this rich resource and make behavioral scientists aware of best practices and potential pitfalls in the use of such models. The objective of the **LLMs for Behavioral Science Workshop** is to provide a platform for researchers to discuss the successes, challenges, and future possibilities of using language models for behavioral science research, create a collaborative hub of researchers, and develop a unified vision for the use of language models in the behavioral sciences. 

One goal of the workshop is to provide a training opportunity for early-career (doctoral, postdoctoral) researchers through attending lectures, discussions, and interacting with experts in the field. The workshop also includes a hands-on **[training](training.html)** component to take place on the first day.  

The workshop will gather a core faculty consisting of leading researchers in the computational and behavioral sciences as well as a number of early-career researchers in these fields who will engage in active and structured discussions around specific themes as detailed in the **[workshop](workshop.html)** program. See the section on **[people](people.html)** for a full list of participants.
